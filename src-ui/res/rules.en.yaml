All shaded cells form an orthogonally contiguous area."
recoil: "Draw a path from the diamond cell that visits several cells in the grid.\n1. The path cannot branch off or revisit a cell it has visited before.\n2. Every time the path enters a cell, an obstacle is placed in the first available cell in the opposite direction. This cell may skip over gaps in the grid, other obstacles, or cells that were previously visited by the path.\n3. The path cannot enter a cell if the corresponding obstacle can't be placed inside the grid.\n4. All cells must be used by a line or an obstacle."
tjunction: "Place a T-junction in every empty cell.\n1. Two adjacent cells cannot have a T-junction in the same orientation.\n2. There can be no dangling lines. All lines must connect to other T-junctions, shaded cells, or the edge of the grid.\n3. A shaded cell may not have multiple T-junctions of the same orientation connect to it.\n4. A number indicates how many T-junctions connect to this cell.\n5. All T-junctions must be connected."
yajirushi: "Place an arrow in some of the empty cells.\n1. Two arrows which point toward each other form a pair. All arrows must be paired.\n2. Paired arrows must not be in adjacent cells.\n3. All cells between a pair of arrows must be empty.\n4. All empty cells must be located between one or two pairs of arrows."
dotchi2: "Draw lines through orthogonally adjacent cells to form a loop.\n1. The loop cannot branch off or cross itself.\n2. Within a region, the loop must pass through all black circles and no white circles, or all white circles and no black circles.\n3. All regions must have at least one circle that is used by the loop.\n4. The loop must go straight on white circles and turn on black circles."
arrowflow: "Place an arrow in every empty cell.\n1. Identical arrows cannot be adjacent.\n2. Following the arrows must lead to one of the numbers.\n3. Each number indicates how many arrows lead to that goal."
japanesesums: "Place some numbers from the given range into the grid, and shade the rest of the cells.\n1. Numbers cannot repeat in a row or column.\n2. Clues outside the grid indicate the sums of the numbers in groups of consecutive numbered cells in the corresponding row or column, in order from left to right or top to bottom. Sums must be separated by at least one shaded cell.\n3. A question mark represents an unknown sum.\n4. Rows or columns without clues can have any amount of sums."
retsurin: "Shade some cells on the board, and draw a single loop that goes through all remaining cells.\n1. The loop cannot branch off or cross itself.\n2. Shaded cells cannot be orthogonally adjacent.\n3. Cells with numbers or question marks cannot be shaded, and are not part of the loop.\n4. A number indicates the amount of shaded cells in the same row as the clue or in the same column, but it must not indicate both."
forestwalk: "Draw lines to form a single network that goes through every numbered cell.\n1. The network cannot have dead ends or 4-way crossings.\n2. Every visited forest cell must have a T-junction.\n3. There can be no T-junctions outside of forest cells.\n4. A number indicates how many cells make up the continuous unshaded section of the network that the number is on."
wataridori: "Draw lines between the circles to form pairs.\n1. Lines cannot cross or overlap each other.\n2. A line can enter and exit a room no more than once.\n3. A number indicates the amount of different rooms visited by its connected line."
sumiwake: "You're given a board divided into rooms. Shade some cells on the board.\n1. Shaded cells cannot be horizontally or vertically adjacent.\n2. An outlined circle overlaps exactly one shaded cell. A filled circle overlaps two shaded cells.\n3. There cannot be a horizontal or vertical line of unshaded cells that goes through 2 or more region borders.\n4. All unshaded cells on the board form an orthogonally connected area."
narrow: "Draw lines along the dotted lines to divide the grid into regions.\n1. Each region contains exactly one symbol.\n2. Regions may not be rectangular in shape.\n3. Two regions with the same symbol must have a different shape, counting rotations and reflections as the same.\n4. No 2x2 block may consist of cells which all belong to regions with the same symbol."
distopia: "Place some shapes from the bank into the grid. Shapes can be rotated or mirrored.\n1. A shape can be used no more than once. There cannot be shapes in the grid that aren't present in the bank.\n2. Two shapes cannot be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent.\n3. A number indicates the shortest distance to a shaded cell in the 4 cardinal directions, multiplied by the amount of directions where the distance is minimal.\n4. A cell with a clue cannot overlap a shape."
kurarin: "Shade some cells on the board, and draw a single loop that goes through all remaining cells.\n1. The loop cannot branch off or cross itself.\n2. A black circle overlaps more shaded cells than unshaded cells.\n3. A white circle overlaps more unshaded cells than shaded cells.\n4. A gray circle overlaps an equal number of shaded and unshaded cells."
